I guess it is about time I divulge the purpose of Promethean Visions. I have a singular passion in life - creation. I guess you could probably pick up on that from my last post. From Legos as a child to CAD projects as a college student, I love to create. But, there is a big difference in creating as a hobby and creating as a way of life. The first is a fun way to pass time; the second is the most frustrating endeavor I have ever endured. However, reward is birthed from such frustration (or so I am told.)

I set about turning my hobby into a way of life almost two years ago, and the transition is still not complete. Going down this road has caused me to put the goals of my youth on hold. This has been by far the hardest pill for me to swallow, but I think a little rebellion can be good for the soul. For 22 years I knew the road that lay ahead. I knew the hardships to come, as well as the successes those struggles would bring. Today, however, I can not say where I will be in a year, or even a month for that matter but I will be hard at work wherever I am. I have found that there is no better motivator than fear, and fear of the unknown has been ingrained in the souls of humanity since the beginning of time. For once in my life rebellion has placed me waist deep in this unknown. The waters that lie on the horizon are truly uncharted, but, trust me, I am more motivated because of it. 

Rebellion is a stigmatized word in our society often described as "An act of violent or open resistance to an established government or ruler." I am referring to it merely as the action or process of resisting convention. Whether we like to admit it or not, our lives are run by familiarity. It is this familiarity that I am most afraid of. Where is the fun in living a predictable life? Two years ago I was presented with a fork in my road and my rebellious self decided to chose the path less traveled by...

Will you do the same?
